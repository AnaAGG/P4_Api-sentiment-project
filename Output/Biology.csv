Victor Scheffer;M;Although Nature needs thousands or millions of years to create a new species, man needs only a few dozen years to destroy one;science
Antonie van Leeuwenhoek;M;I believe that thirty million of these animalcules together would not take up as much room, or be as big, as a coarse grain of sand;science
Richard Dawkins;M;Biology is the study of the complex things in the Universe. Physics is the study of the simple ones;science
J. B. S. Haldane;M;If physics and biology one day meet, and one of the two is swallowed up, that one will be biology;science
Aristotle;M;By ‘life,’ we mean a thing that can nourish itself and grow and decay;science
Har Gobind Khorana;M;Everything that human beings or living animals do is done by protein molecules. And therefore the kind of proteins that one has and therefore the ability one has is determined by the genes that one has;science
Fred Hoyle;M;Instead of being the biological center of the Universe, I believe our planet is just an assembly station, but one with a major advantage over most other places. The constant presence of liquid water almost everywhere on the Earth is a huge advantage for life, especially for assembling life into complex forms by the process we call evolution;science
James Watson;M;The finding of the double helix thus brought us not only joy but great relief. It was unbelievably interesting and immediately allowed us to make a serious proposal for the mechanism of gene duplication;science
Francis Crick;M;The development of biology is going to destroy to some extent our traditional grounds for ethical belief and it is not easy to see what to put in their place;science
Stephen Jay Gould;M;Nearly 2.5 billion years of prokaryotic cells and nothing else – two-thirds of life’s history in stasis at the lowest level of recorded complexity… Why did life remain at stage 1 for two-thirds of its history if complexity offers such benefits? ;science
James Lovelock;M;"I think it would be quite wrong to suggest that my colleagues have rejected me or that I reject them. Quite the reverse. It’s only a small, vociferous group – mainly biologists, I’m sorry to say – that go beyond ordinary scientific criticism and start becoming personal

Rachel Carson;F;This is an era of specialists, each of whom sees his own problem and is unaware of or intolerant of the larger frame into which it fits;science
Bertrand Russell;M;Why the dinosaurs died out is not known, but it is supposed to be because they had minute brains and devoted themselves to the growth of weapons of offense in the shape of numerous horns;science
Edmund Beecher Wilson;M;Perhaps it is not amiss to remark that the biologist may not hope to solve the ultimate problems of life any more than the chemist and physicist may hope to penetrate the final mysteries of existence in the non-living world;science
Alfred Russel Wallace;M;All increasing or dominant species (and it is from these that new species arise) vary considerably, in all their parts, organs and faculties, in every generation;science
Susumu Ohno;M;"Did the genome of our cave-dwelling predecessors contain a set or sets of genes which enable modern man to compose music of infinite complexity and write novels with profound meaning? …It looks as though the early Homo was already provided with the intellectual potential which was in great excess of what was needed to cope with the environment of his time

Auguste Compte;M;The time however has arrived when biology must, like the other sciences, make a fresh start in a purely speculative direction, free from all entanglement with medical or any other art;science
Rita Levi-Montalcini;F;Although the alternate ‘wax and wane’ cycles are the rule rather than the exception in all fields of human endeavor, in that of biological sciences the ‘wane’ is all too often indicative of a justified loss of faith in the rational and methodical approach that had at first raised so much hope;science
Stan Ulam;M;"I believe that new mathematical schemata, new systems of axioms, certainly new systems of mathematical structures will be suggested by the study of the living world
";science
Shinya Yamanaka;M;Dr. Ikemoto repeatedly told me that we should not perform research that simply reproduced somebody else’s results. Rather, we should do something unique and new;science
Stephen Jay Gould;M;Evolution is one of the half-dozen shattering ideas that science has developed to overturn past hopes and assumptions, and to enlighten our current thoughts.;science
Charles Darwin;M;"On the principle of successive variations not always supervening at an early age, and being inherited at a corresponding not early period of life, we can clearly see why the embryos of mammals, birds, reptiles, and fishes should be so closely alike, and should be so unlike the adult forms.

Carl Sagan;M;Our thoughts, visions and fantasies have a physical reality. A thought is made of hundreds of electrochemical impulses;science
Herbert Maule Richards;M;Botany consists in the gathering of plants, and the dismembering of them, in connection with the use of a complicated terminology. That is the beginning and end of botany as it is understood by the majority;science
Svante Arrhenius;M;"It is thus probable that germs of the lowest organisms known to us are continually being carried away from the earth and the other planets upon which they exist. As seeds in general, so most of these spores, thus carried away, will no doubt meet death in the cold infinite space of the universe. Yet a small number of spores will fall on some other world, and may there be able to spread life, if conditions be suitable
